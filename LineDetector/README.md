##### Implemented with: #####

* OpenCV 2.3
* C/C++ using Microsoft Visual Studio 2010 IDE.

##### OpenCV features used & used techniques: #####

* Gaussian smoothing for image noise removal
* Canny edge detection [1]
* Hough transform for line detection
* Haar features for vehicle detection (hypothesis generation) [2]
* Vehicle hypothesis verification using horizontal edges and symmetry [3]

##### Possible improvements: #####

* k-Means clustering for Hough lines
* Kalman/Gabor/RANSAC filtering of sampled data
* KLT (Kanade-Lucas-Tomasi) feature tracker for vehicle tracking
* Vanishing point detection using Gaussian probability model
* Better lane tracking(probability methods), stability & accuracy
* More accurate vehicle hypothesis checking
* Alternative IPM(inverse perspective mapping) lane detection method
* Road area extraction & detection for roads without lanes
* Ability to process night vision situations
* Include road shadow removal
* Speed upgrades
* Road sign and traffic lights detection
